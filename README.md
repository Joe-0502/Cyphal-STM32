# Cyphal-STM32
1. Deleted the failed Cyphaltest1 and Cyphaltest2.
2. Cyphaltest3 successfully transmitted a heartbeat message, but it used the DSDL definitions and libcanard files from STM32-HAL-Libcanard.
3. Added node1 and node2, using the official DSDL definitions and libcanard files (from the official sources/website).
4. libcanard-master is the libcanard source code downloaded from the official GitHub repository.
5. nunavut-out5iv3aeny contains the files generated from the basic DSDL definitions using the Nunavut tool/website.
